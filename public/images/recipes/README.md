# Recipe Images

This directory contains images for recipes displayed on the website.

## File Naming Convention

Recipe images should be named using the recipe slug (filename without .md extension) and can be in any of the following formats:
- `.jpg` or `.jpeg`
- `.png`
- `.webp`
- `.svg`

For example, for a recipe file `chocolate-chip-cookies.md`, the image should be named:
- `chocolate-chip-cookies.jpg`
- `chocolate-chip-cookies.png`
- `chocolate-chip-cookies.webp`
- or `chocolate-chip-cookies.svg`

## Current Placeholders

The SVG files in this directory are placeholders. Replace them with actual high-quality food photography for better visual appeal.

## Recommended Image Specifications

- **Format**: JPEG or WebP for photographs
- **Dimensions**: At least 800x600 pixels (4:3 aspect ratio recommended)
- **File Size**: Under 500KB (optimized for web)
- **Style**: Well-lit, appetizing food photography
