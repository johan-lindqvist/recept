## Ingredients

- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

3. In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy (about 2-3 minutes).

4. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla extract.

5. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients until just combined.

6. Fold in chocolate chips.

7. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased cookie sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

8. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown around the edges.

9. Cool on baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.

## Tips

- For chewier cookies, slightly underbake them and let them finish cooking on the hot pan.
- Room temperature ingredients mix more easily and create a better texture.
- Don't overmix the dough after adding flour to keep cookies tender.
