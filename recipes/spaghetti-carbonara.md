## Ingredients

- 1 lb spaghetti
- 6 oz pancetta or guanciale, diced
- 4 large eggs
- 1 cup Pecorino Romano cheese, freshly grated
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Salt for pasta water

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil and cook spaghetti according to package directions until al dente.

2. While pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add pancetta and cook until crispy, about 5-7 minutes.

3. In a bowl, whisk together eggs, grated Pecorino Romano, and a generous amount of black pepper.

4. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.

5. Remove the skillet from heat and add the hot pasta to the pancetta, tossing to combine.

6. Quickly pour the egg mixture over the pasta, tossing constantly. The residual heat will cook the eggs into a creamy sauce. Add reserved pasta water a little at a time if needed to achieve desired consistency.

7. Serve immediately with extra Pecorino Romano and black pepper.

## Tips

- Use freshly grated cheese for the best flavor and texture.
- Work quickly when adding the egg mixture to prevent scrambling.
- The key is using the pasta's heat to create a creamy sauce without scrambling the eggs.
- Traditional carbonara doesn't include cream or garlic.
